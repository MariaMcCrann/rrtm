surface albedo panel (dirty snow, etc.)

aerosols => can only put low or the "geoengineering option"
clouds go all the way across

clouds' properties as a function of altitude and temperature?

splines

greenhouse gases

an arrow representing vertical flow, allowing or disallowing clouds

boundary layer? for humidity? sulfur?

how should help be done?

area down below? tooltip?



control panels:
sunlight
(where you choose the setting)
(constrain your angle based on latitude?)
albedo
aerosols
clouds
GHGs
pressure
temperature
upwelling


yellow is down, 
blue is down, green is up?

top of atmosphere flux

sunlight intensity at the ground (so you can see the change )

ideas for the image

three point temperature profile
surface, tropopause, top of atmosphere. (isothermal stratosphere?)

how do you explain TOA? scales to show

ink

Notes on CliMT:

Code could be DRYer; specifically:
    - why get_nlev in Driver.f90?
